Contributing

Your icons have to apply following rules.

1. They have to be either public domain or CC-Zero
2. They have to be very realistic. I suggest to derive them from photos.
3. Characters have to be embedded as paths, not as characters in a 
   special font.

You can either contribute your icons via a pull request or via email 
(you can get my email adress via writing me a personal message via 
Twitter (@Nakaner) or OpenStreetMap (Nakaner).
